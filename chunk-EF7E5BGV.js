Kingsley Read, the inventor of the Shavian alphabet and a dedicated linguist, used mirrored characters to highlight the close relationship between certain sounds. For example, in the first lesson, we learned about \u{10451} ('tot'), a phoneme for /t/, that sound is produced in the mouth and is unvoiced. In this lesson, we will explore its counterpart, the mirrored \u{1045B} ('dead'). Both characters require similar mouth positioning, but the sound of \u{1045B} ('dead'), /d/, is voiced version that uses the vocal cords. Vertical mirroring like this helps demonstrate the distinction between voiced and unvoiced sounds. Horizontal mirroring, is more subtle, highlighting sounds that are phonetically similar but differ in their physical articulation. This clever design visually reinforces phonetic relationships, aiding in the quicker and more intuitive learning of Shavian.
