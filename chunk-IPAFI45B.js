Then, in lesson two, we talked about character pairs and how Kingsley designed mirrored pairs based on how similar they sound. One interesting detail is how some characters are mirrored horizontally to indicate whether they represent voiced or unvoiced sounds. So far, I\u2019ve introduced these concepts ad hoc as they came up, but now let\u2019s dive deeper into how Shavian formally organizes characters into groups. "),t(),i(5,"p"),e(6," Kingsley sorted the Shavian alphabet into four groups: tall, deep, short, and compound characters. Each group has visual cues that hint at the sound it represents.

Their tall shape can help you remember that these sounds are produced high up in the mouth as opposed to the vocal cords. '),t(),i(12,"li")(13,"strong"),e(14,"Deep Characters"),t(),e(15,' drop below the baseline when written and represent voiced sounds, such as \u{1045B} ("dead"). The way they dip down visually mirrors how these sounds are made lower in the vocal cords through vibration. '),t(),i(16,"li")(17,"strong"),e(18,"Short Characters"),t(),e(19,' stay within the baseline and represent softer, central sounds like \u{10466} ("if") and \u{1046F} ("nun"). Since they sit more centrally, it\u2019s a good reminder that these sounds combine aspects of both the mouth and vocal cords. '),t(),i(20,"li")(21,"strong"),e(22,"Compound Characters"),t(),e(23,' are a bit more complex, with extra shapes or features to capture sounds that vary depending on accents, like how "car" sounds different in British English ("cah") and American English ("car"). These characters are flexible and have regional pronunciations that keeping spelling consistent no matter your accent. '),t()(),n(24,"br"),i(25,"p"),e(26," By grouping characters this way, Kingsley made Shavian easier to learn.

As we shift our focus to pronunciation, these groupings give you a solid foundation to understand how each character works in the system. "),t(),i(27,"p"),e(28," In this lesson and the next, we\u2019ll focus on the next five most common sounds in English, along with their mirrored counterparts. By the end of these two sessions, you\u2019ll have learned 20 out of the 40 non-compound Shavian characters\u2014covering half of all the sounds in the English language.
